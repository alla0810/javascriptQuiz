## User Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores 
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

* WHEN I click the start button, THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

* WHEN I answer a question, THEN I am presented with another question

* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly, THEN time is subtracted from the clock   
  ➨ How much subtraction? (-10 seconds) from the start page

* When the user answer correctly, THEN time is added by (+10 seconds)    
  ➨ Added by the author.  
  ➨ From the mock-up picture, sometimes the timer exceeds the initial value, which means there should be some addtion of timer value when the answer is correct as a prize.    

* When the user answer correctly, THEN time is added by (+10 seconds) 
  ➨ Added by the author.
  ➨ From the mock-up picture, sometimes the timer exceeds the initial value, which means there should be some addtion of timer value when the answer is correct as a prize.
